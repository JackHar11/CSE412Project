Requirements for Project:

Final-Report Phase (10 pts): In the final report, each group has to demonstrate your final application (e.g. Web, Mobile) that interacts with the database your created in Phase 2. The application will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
6pt will be used to evaluate how much the final interface matches the application requirements and database schema you created in Phase 1. and 2.
2pt will be used to evaluate how intuitive and neat the interface you created. These 2 points will be based on the judgement of both the instructor and TA.
2pt will be used to evaluate how good your final application is. However, this time your peers (classmates) will have to rate all projects and the 2 points grade will be based on the overall ranking.
You need give a five-minutes video demonstration as video clip (screen capture), upload it to YouTube and provide the YouTube link. In the demonstration you will have to go through as much of the proposed application functionality.
Turn in the final code as well as database dump (or a link to a public github repository).
Turn in a user manual that guides the user of how to use the application (with screen shots).
The contributions of each team member is REQUIRED.
